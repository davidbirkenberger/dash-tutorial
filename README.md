# Dash tutorial

- `App.layout` describes what the app looks like and is a hierarchical tree of components. 
- The `dash_html_components` library provides classes for all of the HTML tags, and the keyword arguments describe the HTML attributes like style, className, and id. 
- The `dash_core_components` library generates higher-level components like controls and graphs.
